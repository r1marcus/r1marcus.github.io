In recent years, the topic of embedded machine learning has become very popular in AI research. With the help of various compression techniques such as pruning, quantization and others compression techniques, it became possible to run neural networks on embedded devices. These techniques have opened up a whole new application area for machine learning. They range from smart products such as voice assistants to smart sensors that are needed in robotics. Despite the achievements in embedded machine learning, efficient algorithms for training neural networks in constrained domains are still lacking. Training on embedded devices will open up further fields of applications. Efficient training algorithms would enable federated learning on embedded devices, in which the data remains where it was collected, or retraining of neural networks in different domains. In this paper, we summarize techniques that make training on embedded devices possible. We first describe the need and requirements for such algorithms. Then we examine existing techniques that address training in resource-constrained environments as well as techniques that are also suitable for training on embedded devices, such as incremental learning. At the end, we also discuss which problems and open questions still need to be solved in these areas.
